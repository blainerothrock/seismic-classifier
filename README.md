# SeisML
a continuous machine learning experimentation model for seismic data

.. or at least that is the end goal. This is a ongoing project to build a continuously training model that can continuously run
scientific machine learning experiments on seismic data. Progress can be tracked [here]().

## Inspiration 
The inspiration and starting codebase for this model is from the Seismological Research Letters paper 
*[Automating the Detection of Dynamically Triggered Earthquakes via a Deep Metric Learning Algorithm](https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/ssa/srl/article-abstract/91/2A/901/579921/Automating-the-Detection-of-Dynamically-Triggered)*
([codebase](https://github.com/interactiveaudiolab/earthquakes)). Steps to reproducing this paper can be found [here](docs/srl_triggered_earthquake.md).
